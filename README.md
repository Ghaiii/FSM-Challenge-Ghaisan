# FSM-Challenge-Ghaisan Gun
This repository contains a system simulating the diffrent phases of a gun with a FSM system.

# Why a gun?
I picked a gun to use as a reprisantation for my Fsm system because the games i usually play in my spare time are Fps (First person shooter) games. such as Valorant, Csgo, and Cod Warzone.

# States
For this challenge i made an fsm for the 4 states of a gun.
- idle (mag is full) : on this stage the gun is fully loaded and ready to fire at the enemy at anytime.
- firing mode : on this stage the gun is currently firing all the bullets in the guns magazine until it runs out of ammo.
- empty clip : on this stage the gun is out of ammo and needs a reload.
- reloading : on this stage the gun is being reloaded, changing the old magazine with a new loaded one.
