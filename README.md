# FSM-Challenge-Ghaisan Gun
This repository contains a system simulating the video game logic for the character Mario from the Super Mario series written in C language using Finite State Machine.

# Why a gun?
I picked a gun to use as a reprisantation for my Fsm system because the games i usually play in my spare time are Fps (First person shooter) games. such as Valorant, Csgo, and Cod Warzone.

# States
For this challenge i made an fsm for the 4 states of a gun.
- idle (mag is full)
- firing mode
- empty clip
- reloading
